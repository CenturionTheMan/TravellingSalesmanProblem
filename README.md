# Travelling Salesman Problem

## Overview

This repository contains an implementation of a few algorithms for the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) in WinForms/C#. The TSP is a classic problem in the field of optimization and graph theory, where the goal is to find the shortest possible route that visits once all vertices and returns to the original vertex (minimal Hamilton cycle).

## Features

- C# implementation of the TSP solver.
- Supports multiple algorithms for solving TSP, such as:
  - Brute Force
  - Dynamic Programming
  - Branch And Bounds
  - Simulated Annealing
  - Genetic Algorithm

 ## Loading files
Application can create random adjeancy matrix or load one from [TSPLIB](http://comopt.ifi.uni-heidelberg.de/software/TSPLIB95/index.html) (.xml, .atsp).
